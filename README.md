# GENERATING-TIME-TABLE-USING-GRAPHS

# Fast University Timetable Generator

## Overview
This project aims to generate timetables for Fast University using graph theory concepts, specifically bipartite matching algorithms. The program assigns sections/courses to rooms/timeslots in a way that maximizes the number of matches, considering the availability of rooms and timeslots.

## Features
- Bipartite graph representation of sections/courses and rooms/timeslots.
- Maximum matching algorithms to find optimal assignments.
- Timetable generation for each day of the week.
- Output in CSV format for easy viewing and sharing.

## Dependencies
- Python 3.x
- NetworkX library
- Matplotlib library
- Pandas library

## Usage
1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/fast-university-timetable.git
    ```
2. Install dependencies:
    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3. Run the program:
    ```
    python timetable_generator.py
    ```
4. View the generated timetable CSV files for each day of the week.

## Configuration
- Edit the `timetable_generator.py` file to adjust parameters such as section/course lists, room lists, and timeslots.
- Modify the code to include additional constraints or preferences as needed, such as teacher availability or room capacities.

## Contributions
Contributions are welcome! If you have any ideas for improvements or new features, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.

## Credits
This project was developed as part of a Graph Theory course project under the supervision of Dr. Nazish Kawal at Fast University.
